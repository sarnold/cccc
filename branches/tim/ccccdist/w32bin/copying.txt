The majority of the files in this directory come from the cygwin-b20
port of the GNU operating system tools to the Win32 platform, compiled
with the Cygnus port of the GNU compiler for Win32.  These files come 
from the package usertools.exe, available from 
http://www.sourceware.cygnus.com.  

The version of gmake.exe is a patched version of the Cygnus version of 
GNU make, sourced from http://www.mozilla.org.  The patches are not
relevant to the current development, it was just more convenient as the
version of make on the Cygnus site is part of larger archive of development
tools which I did not wish to download.

I believe that all of the binaries are compiled from source code placed 
under the GNU Public License.  The current text of that license, plus
original source code for all of these binaries is available from 
http://www.gnu.org.  Source code used to compile these specific binaries
should be available from the respective sites identified above.
