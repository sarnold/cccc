/* 
** Token objects are used to count the occurences of states which 
** our analyser is interested in within the text.  Any metric which
** can be reduced to lexical counting on the text can be recorded
** this way.
**
** This implementation counts the following features:
**   tokens
**   comment lines
**   lines containing at least one token of code
**  
** It also makes a lexical count for the following tokens, each of which
** is expected to increase McCabe's cyclomatic complexity (Vg) for the 
** section of code by one unit:
**  IF FOR WHILE SWITCH BREAK RETURN ? && ||
**
** Note that && and || create additional paths through the code due to C/C++ 
** short circuit evaluation of logical expressions.
**
** Also note the way SWITCH constructs are counted: the desired increment
** in Vg is equal to the number of cases provided for, including the 
** default case, whether or not an action is defined for it.  This is acheived
** by counting the SWITCH at the head of the construct as a surrogate for 
** the default case, and counting BREAKs as surrogates for the individual
** cases.  This approach yields the correct results provided that the
** coding style in use ensures the use of BREAK after all non-default
** cases, and forbids 'drop through' from one case to another other than
** in the case where two or more values of the switch variable require
** identical actions, and no executable code is defined between the 
** case gates (as in the switch statement in ANTLRToken::CountToken() below).
