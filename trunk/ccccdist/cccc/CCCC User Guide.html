<h1><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>CCCC is a tool for the analysis of source code in various languages
(primarily C++), which generates a report in HTML format on various
measurements of the code processed. Although the tool was originally
implemented to process C++ and ANSI C, the present version is also able
to process Java source files, and support has been present in earlier
versions for Ada95. The name CCCC stands for 'C and C++ Code Counter'. </p>
<p>Measurements of source code of this kind are generally referred to
as 'software metrics', or more precisely 'software product metrics' (as
the term 'software metrics` also covers measurements of the software
process, which are called 'software process metrics'). There is a
reasonable consensus among modern opinion leaders in the software
engineering field that measurement of some kind is probably a Good
Thing, although there is less consensus on what is worth measuring and
what the measurements mean. </p>
<p>CCCC has been developed as freeware, and is released in source code
form. Users are encouraged to compile the program themselves, and to
modify the source to reflect their preferences and interests. </p>
<p>The simplest way of using CCCC is just to run it with the names of a
selection of files on the command line like this: </p>
<tt>
<p>cccc my_types.h big.h small.h *.cc </p>
</tt>
<p>Alternatively, the for a complex hierarchy, the user could enter a
command like this:</p>
<tt></tt>
<p><tt>find . | cccc - </tt>(on Unix family platforms)</p>
<p>or</p>
<tt></tt>
<p><tt>dir /b/s | cccc - </tt>(on DOS/Windows family platforms)</p>
<p>CCCC will process each of the files specified on the command line
(using standard wildcard processing were appropriate), or, if the '-'
option is specified in the standard input stream. For each file, named,
CCCC will examine the extension of the filename, and if the extension
is recognized as indicating a supported language, the appropriate
parser will run on the file. As each file is parsed, recognition of
certain constructs will cause records to be written into an internal
database. When all files have been processed, a report on the contents
of the internal database will be generated in HTML format. By default
the main summary HTML report is generated to the file cccc.htm in a
subdirectory called .cccc of the the current working directory, with
detailed reports on each module (i.e. C++ or Java class) identified by
the analysis run. <br>
</p>
<p>In addition to the summary and detailed HTML reports, the run will
cause generation of corresponding summary and detailed reports in XML
format, and a further file called cccc.db to be created. cccc.db will
contain a dump of the internal database of the program in a format
delimited with the character '@' (chosen because it is one of the few
characters which cannot legally appear in C/C++ non-comment source
code). </p>
<p>The report contains a number of tables identifying the modules in
the files submitted and covering: </p>
<ul>
  <li>measures of the procedural volume and complexity of each module
and its functions; </li>
  <li>measures of the number and type of the relationships each module
is a party to either as a client or a supplier; </li>
  <li>identification of any parts of the source code submitted which
the program failed to parse; and </li>
  <li>a summary report over the whole body of code processed of the
measures identified above. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the data presented in the report may be displayed in an
emphasized form (either with a bold or italic font, or with a red or
yellow background). These are items which have been identified as lying
outside ranges which have been laid down as desirable for the
particular items. A bold font or red background indicates a value which
exceeds a threshold defined as being dangerous for that measure, while
italic fonts and yellow backgrounds indicate values below the danger
threshold but still above a second lower threshold which has been laid
down to indicate cause for concern. The two thresholds are configurable
by the user of the tool: see the section below on <a
 href="#config_treatment">configuring metric treatment</a> for more
details. </p>
<h1><a name="report">Report Contents</a></h1>
<p>The report generated by CCCC normally consists of six tables plus a
table of contents at the beginning and some informational material
about CCCC itself at the end. </p>

<h1><a name="counting">Counting methods</a></h1>
<p>CCCC implements simple algorithms to calculate each of the measures
presented. The algorithms are intended to present a useful
approximation to the underlying quantities, rather than meticulously
exact counting: in general agreement with manual counts based on the
same definitions should agree with CCCC to within 2-3%. If larger
discrepancies are discovered, or if this level of agreement is not
considered adequate, users are welcome to modify the source code to
implement closer agreement, or to change the counting behaviour to
reflect a desired basis of calculation. The basic definitions of each
count are as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Number of Modules (NOM)<br>
CCCC defines modules in terms of a grouping of member functions: C++
classes and namespaces, Java classes and interfaces and Ada packages
are all defined as modules. In addition to this, functions which are
not members of one of these structures are treated as belonging to an
anonymous module, which is counted if it has member functions. </li>
  <li>Lines of Code (LOC)<br>
This count follows the industry standard of counting non-blank,
non-comment lines of source code. Preprocessor lines are treated as
blank. Class and function declarations are counted, but declarations of
global data are ignored. There may be some double counting of lines in
class definitions as the algorithm treats the total over a module as
the sum of lines belonging to the module itself and lines belonging to
its member functions (the declarations and definitions of member
functions in the body of the class definition will contribute to both
counts). </li>
  <li>Comment Lines (COM)<br>
Any line which contains any part of a comment for the language
concerned is treated as a comment by CCCC, and is allocated to the
module and member of the next following 'real' token. This ensures that
leading comments are treated as part of the function or class
definition which follows them. There is one exception to this rule: the
Rational Rose design tool is known to insert directives into source
files disguised as C++ comments with the prefix '//##'. These are not
counted as comments, however all other comment structures are, even if
there is no content within the comment delimiters, or the content is
commented-out source code. </li>
  <li>McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity(MVG)<br>
The formal definition of cyclomatic complexity is that it is the count
of linearly independent paths through a flow of control graph derived
from a subprogram. A pragmatic approximation to this can be found by
counting language keywords and operators which introduce extra decision
outcomes. This can be shown to be quite accurate in most cases. In the
case of C++, the count is incremented for each of the following tokens:
'if','while','for','switch','break','&amp;&amp;','||' </li>
</ul>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>Note that the boolean operations introduce extra paths through the
code because the second operand may or may not be evaluated according
to the value of the first operand. Note also that the treatment of
switch statements is problematic: it is quite common for multiple
'case' labels to be attached to the same block of code, so counting
these might overstate the value. Counting the 'break' tokens instead is
better so long as their are no case labels in the middle of the block
of code which the break terminates. The motive for counting the
'switch' token is to provide for the default case, which gives rise to
a path whether or not the programmer defines a default label. Counting
the break token in this way may distort the count where it is used in
other contexts (i.e. to exit from a block). </p>
</dir>
</dir>
<ul>
  <li>Weighted methods per class (WMC)<br>
This is a count of the member functions known to exist in a class.
Knowledge of existence of a function is only gained from declarations
or definitions directly contained in files processed by CCCC: files
included by a preprocessor are ignored, and CCCC does not at present
identify invocations of member or non-member functions within
procedural code. </li>
  <li>Fan-In, Fan-Out (FI,FIc,FIv,FO,FOc,FOv)<br>
Traditionally, use relationships between modules were identified by
counting function invocations or access to module data in procedural
code. CCCC identifies relationships only through structures apparent in
the definitions of the interfaces of C++ classes or Java classes or
interfaces. The specific relationships which can be detected are
inheritance of a supplier class by a client, containment of an instance
of a supplier class in a client, and the existence of member functions
of the client class which accept or return an instance of the supplier. </li>
</ul>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>While these relationships may seem unrelated to the invocation and
module data counts, they are likely to show a strong corelation because
of the fact that in an object oriented environment, it is likely (but
not inevitable) that the low-level use relationships of invocation and
direct access to data structures require an object of the class of the
supplier module to be available. This availability can be through
instantiation of an instance of the supplier class within procedural
code, but will often be due to the existence of one of the higher level
relationships described above. </p>
<p>The counts of Fan-In and Fan-Out are regarded as a measure of the
structural quality of a program, with high values of either (and
particularly high values of both within the same module) indicating
increased risk of changes required in one module requiring changes
across other modules. CCCC chooses to define the relationship counts in
such a way that each supplier or client module is counted only once,
however many separate ways the relationship is detected. CCCC applies
filtering to the relationships identified to distinguish between
different kinds of uses which may carry with them different levels of
structural risk. There are two filters: visibility and concreteness. </p>
<p>The visibility filter removes from consideration relationships which
are known to be only accessible from the private interface of a module.
Relationships which are defined in the visible part of the interface
can be exploited by clients of the current module, thus forcing those
clients also to be clients of the current module's supplier. Visible
relationships also increase the range of operations available on an
object, thus increasing the cognitive complexity of the interface from
the point of view of a programmer required to use a module. </p>
<p>The concreteness filter removes from consideration relationships
which do not create a dependency of the implementation of the client
module on the implementation of the supplier class. Dependency-creating
relationships increase risk because they may not be cyclical, and thus
inhibit the creation of other relationships. They also inhibit the
ability of modules to be built separately, requiring recompilation of
the client module when the supplier changes. The test for this filter
in C++ is whether a forward declaration of the supplier class is
adequate to allow the client module definition to be compiled:
containment and parameter passing where the client module is modified
by a referential operator are allowed in this case, containment or
passing by value or inheritance are all dependency-creating. In Java,
relationships except inheritance are treated as non-dependency
creating. </p>
</dir>
</dir>
<ul>
  <li>Number of Modules (NOM)<br>
All instances of the following syntactic constructs are treated as
modules: C++ classes and namespaces; Java classes and interfaces, Ada
packages. There are contexts where the analyser detects something which
may belong to one of these categories but may not. In this case, the
name is treated as a module name if and only if member functions are
identified for it. Functions which do not belong to a module of one of
the categories defined above are treated as belonging to a single
anonymous module: if any members are identified for this module it is
also counted. </li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="command">Command-line syntax</a></h1>
<p>The command line flags supported by CCCC are defined in the file
ccccmain.cc.  A brief usage message can be generated on standard output
by entering the command 'cccc --help'.  The same message will be
generated on standard error if an invalid command line is entered.  As

<p>CCCC was produced as an artifact of an academic research project.
The primary motivation was to provide a platform for the exploration of
issues related to metrics. The program is not now, and will never
become, a commercial standard supported product. While CCCC attempts to
recover from parse failures, there are some language constructs which
cause crashes, and others which result in code going unanalyzed. If
CCCC does not report syntax errors and terminates normally, it is
likely that all files have been analyzed, otherwise it is strongly
recommended that the user does some kind of independent check on the
quantity of code ignored, rather than relying on CCCC's own report on
'Rejected Extents'. </p>
<p>There is one further important disclaimer. As noted above, the
primary motivation for the development of CCCC was to aid an academic
project to investigate the use of metrics. Over the five years or so
the project was running various research activities were conducted,
culminating in a practical experiment into the value of metric analysis
data in a simulated software engineering task. The aim of this final
experiment was to attempt to demonstrate a benefit from the use of such
data, its conclusion was that, at best, the presence of a benefit was
"not proven". The research project, including the design and outcomes
of the final experiment is described at
http://www.fchs.ecu.edu.au/~tlittlef, which includes a link to download
a PDF of the final PhD thesis arising from the project. </p>
