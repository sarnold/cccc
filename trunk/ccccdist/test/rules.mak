# rules.mak
# This file contains cross-platform rules to support testing of CCCC
# it is intended to be included by a platform specific makefile.

# Before this file is included the following variables need to be
# defined:
# CP=<command to copy a file>
# RM=<program to remove a file>
# RMDIR=<program to remove a directory>
# MV=<program to move a file>
# ECHO=<echo program>
# DIFF=<differencing program>
# PATHSEP=<path separator - \ for win32, / for Unix>
# CCCC=<path to CCCC program>

# We may also want to define CCCC_DEBUG_FLAGS on the command line
# if we would like to see some or all of the debug output available
# from CCCC.
# CCCC_DEBUG_FLAGS= --debug_mask=0xFF

# We define a phony target extensions to enable us to force execution of tests
# under normal and debugging conditions and also to provide a shortcut way
# of 'blessing' the results of a run as the reference values

# The --report_mask qualifier controls which parts of the HTML report are
# generated.  We choose to generate all information in the main file,
# but not the separate HTML reports on each module or the source listing.
# We also supress the generation date, so that reports generated at different
# times can be compared. 
# At this stage we are happy if the numbers in the generated report look OK:
# some day soon we need to tidy up the code so that when a selective report
# like this is generated it does not contain loose HTML HREF tags.

# the fourth test case applies to the ability to specify an option

# regression tests
# PRN1 and PRN2 sent in by Kenneth H. Cox
# PRN3 sent in by Dr D. Ruppert, against CCCC 3.pre39
# PRN4 prepared by TL to check for problems with classes being mapped
# to modules via their qualified name (CCCC policy is that the simple name
# is used)
# PRN5 prepared by TL to check for problem due to relationships being
# created involving built-in types
# PRN6 based on a test case reported by ??? 
# PRN7 based on a test case reported by Larry Peters of ATI
# PRN8 based on a test case reported by Eric Pischel
# PRN9-PRN12 based on test cases reported by Victor B Putz
# PRN13 based on an exmple program from Sun's Java Tutorial.
