# The --report_mask qualifier controls which parts of the HTML report are
# generated.  We choose to generate all information in the main file,
# but not the separate HTML reports on each module or the source listing.
# We also supress the generation date, so that reports generated at different
# times can be compared. 
# At this stage we are happy if the numbers in the generated report look OK:
# some day soon we need to tidy up the code so that when a selective report
# like this is generated it does not contain loose HTML HREF tags.

# PRN1 and PRN2 sent in by Kenneth H. Cox

# PRN5 prepared by TL to check for problem due to relationships being
